            <p>Ngutu.org is an idea with the goal to stablish a strong identity, social and economic for the re-connection of the African diasporas with each other and Mother Africa. We call for global solidarity among Black Africans to assume leadership and entrepeneurship towards the implementation of the great African Commomwealth, centered in Africa and with the diaspora playing an integreated role of embassators for Acquisition and Transfer of Knowledgle and Culture. A World where we all belong.</p>

            <p>As an african living in Europe, that's what I believe: that we cannot fight racism nor the racist, by the simple fact that it is not your intrinsic problem. It's a sociopathic institutional problem that can be solved by the racist self only. We cannot impose an evolution of the racist mindset by exposing it; we are the proof of it. What we can do is to concentrate our focus to rebuild our well-acknowledge creative, productive, prosperous and conscious human civilization.
