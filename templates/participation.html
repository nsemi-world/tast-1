            <p>The <i>Voyages Database</i> reports a total of <span id="TOTAL_VOYAGES"></span> voyages, between <span id="FIRST_VOYAGE_DATE"></span> and <span id="LAST_VOYAGE_DATE"></span>. Not all voyages have dates assigned therefore these dates should not be taken as absolute, but only in the context of the database.</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of the <i>Reconsquita</i>, christian Portugal and Spain established themselves as natural heirs, by culture and conquest, of millenia of Iberian civilization, a long-lasting afro-european center of science, culture, religion and race tolerance by which ancient Iberians, Phoenicians, Jews, Greeks, Romans, Goths and Moors contributed to one of the most intellectually and econommically vibrating civilization the old continent has ever experienced. Techonological advancements in naval instrumentation, sea navigation as much as the vicious of war, fuelled imperialist ambitions of expansion and further conquest.</p>

            <p>As soon as the slave trade became recognizagble as a tremendously profitable activity, many other countries followed them, pushing the slave trade from an Iberian to a broader European, Atlantic and global economy. The information here presented is extracted from the records of the Voyages database as available for public use.</p>

            <p>Unlike other questions (How and Why) these two are easily answered in the relative context of the Voyages database that represents only a fraction of the actual data regarding the Trans-atlantic Slave Trade. The countries that took part in the slave trade are listed in table Table 1.</p>

                <p class="">Looking at variable/column <var><b>Start</b></var> it is possible to group countries according to their first voyage. We detected four main waves of participation that we separate into distinct a phase:</p>

                    <li>early 16th century, the Iberian phase</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>The Iberian Phase.</b> Portugal (1514-1866) is the first reported participant followed by Spain (1519-1865). They were also the latest, in practice and according to the data, to ban slave trade voyages becoming the longest practicioners of that activity: Portugal (353 years) and Spain (347 years).</p>

                <p><b>The West European Phase.</b> The United Kingdom (1562-1811), France (1571-1864) and The Netherlands (1596-1829), north along the atlantic coast, joined the early group of iberian countries. Together these countries appear to have dominated alone the first 150 years of the trans-atlantic slave trade. The United Kingdom and The Netherlands were among the first nations to ban slave voyages, nevertheless completing around 250 years of active participation each. France (294 years) seams to have been less prompt to stop the activity, being one of the latest to leave the slave economy.</p>

                <p><b>The Pan-European Phase.</b> In the seconda half of the 17th century another group of countries developed the naval and military resources to participate in the slave trade: Denmark/Baltic (1641-1842, 202 years), USA (1644-1864, 221 years), Sweden (1646-1820, 175 years), Sardinia (1649-1851, 203 years) and the previleged german Hanseatic Cities together with the state of Brandenburg (1682-1847, 166 years).
                </p>

                <p><b>The Pan-Atlantic Phase.</b> Newly created countries in former colonies continued the practice of slave trading: Brazil (1802), Uruguay (1832), Argentina (1836) and Mexico(1849). Far north atlantic countries also had their fingerprint in the slave trade: Russia (1838) and Norway (1858)
