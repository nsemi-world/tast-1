            <p>Mankind has stood against oppression as long as oppression itself exists. Slavery is one of those oppression forces that delayed us from universal peace and understanding of each other. The suffering of victims of oppression is exactly the measure of the distance to full humanism. While practical justice fail to ensure everyone their theoretical universal rights, may the voices of those who have witnessed in body and mind the inhumanity of older injustices shorten the way to freedeom to all of our children, sisters and brothers who still today are denied a rigtheous place in society.</p>
